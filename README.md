# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple Tic Tac Toe game. Click the board to place your pieces - the game automatically alternates between O's and X's. Once there is a winner, click the board to reset.

I used graphics.py for graphics. It's a lightweight open source library - check it out here: https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/
